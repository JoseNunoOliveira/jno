# *L'Abate Portoghese*
<!-- _backgroundColor: "lightcyan" -->
![bg right:30% fit](./ghezzi-01.jpeg)

* Abott **António da Costa** (1714-1780?) was a Portuguese musician who, born in the Porto region, left the country in 1749 for Rome.

* Travelling to Venice and Paris, he eventually settled in Vienna, where he is thought to have died around 1780.

* Misantrope, he despised the positions offered to him, living most of his life in poverty.

* His intelligence and idiosincratic behaviour attracted the attention of the high nobility, in whose salons he sometimes played his compositions for violin or guitar.

*(...) though I write without principle, I must tell you first of all that, if I compare my music with that of any composer, I believe that his is shaped, like mine, by the orientation of the ear, with the only difference that perhaps in his it does not always belong to him, but to those who made the principles on which his music is based.*"

Ciacchi & Dellaborra ([2020](https://sidm.it/ojs/index.php/fmi/article/view/1044)):

> "*To the ear, the effect is in some points astounding, so much as it is unpredictable, but convincing; in others, vice versa, it is incomprehensible and it seems that the succession of sounds is not determined by logic, but by the pure desire to amaze*".

> "*It is certain that Costa's catalog is not complete. (...) Curious character and musician outside the box of the time, Antonio da Costa is still waiting for an overall and documented judgment on his work.*"

Death possibly mentioned in the letters of [Leonor de Almeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonor_de_Almeida_Portugal,_Marquise_of_Alorna) (Countess of Oyenhausen)?

She met him and was living in Vienna when he died:

Possibly caricatured by Ghezzi in Rome?

> [Pier Leone Ghezzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier_Leone_Ghezzi) (1674-1755) was a very prolific artist.

Aside: Ghezzi's caricature of [Francisco A. Almeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Ant%C3%B3nio_de_Almeida)

What about his **portrait** sent from Vienna in 1780...?

> "(...) [A] *respeito do retrato (...) é possível que V.M. já o tenha em mão (...) O portador é o Snr. Padre Francisco Brandão (...) o qual V.M. ha de procurar em Miragaia (...)*”.

# Summary
<!-- _backgroundColor: "lightcyan" -->
![bg right:33% fit](./violino3.png)

Teófilo Braga ([1879](https://purl.pt/63)):

> "*The name of Antonio da Costa, illustrating the Portuguese art and one of the great in this chorus of victims of obscurantism, resurfaces today as a protest in our history. This is why in every sense we will always proclaim the publication of his letters as a national service.*"

Sure! But now it's time to praise him for what, more than anything else, he was:

> a musician, an original **composer**.
