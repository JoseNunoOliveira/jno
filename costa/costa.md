# *L'Abate Portoghese*
<!-- _backgroundColor: "lightcyan" -->
![bg right:30% fit](./ghezzi-01.jpeg)

* Abott **António da Costa** (1714-1780?) was a Portuguese musician who, born in the Porto region, left the country in 1749 for Rome.

* Travelling to Venice and Paris, he eventually settled in Vienna, where he is thought to have died around 1780.

* Misantrope, he despised the positions offered to him, living most of his life in poverty.

* His intelligence and idiosincratic behaviour attracted the attention of the high nobility, in whose salons he sometimes played his compositions for violin or guitar.

Letter from Martini to Costa:

> "*As soon as I laid eyes on the score (...) came to mind the music that years ago, through the famous Signor Tartini (...) I heard (...). I confess that your music surprised me at first, far removed as it is from all the music of the past and present. Afterwards, listening to it again gave me great pleasure, so much so that I was not satisfied with listening to it, and Your Excellency will remember that through Mr. Tartini I searched for some of your compositions, which he kindly deigned to favor me. But how can I obey you to tell my feelings when I am completely ignorant of the principles on which they are based?*"

January 1779

---

Letter from Costa to Martini:

*(...) But though I write without principle, I must tell you first of all that, if I compare my music with that of any composer, I believe that his is shaped, like mine, by the orientation of the ear, with the only difference that perhaps in his it does not always belong to him, but to those who made the principles on which his music is based*

# The "Porto gang"

What about the "*palestra do Nunes*", the group of partners that Costa left behind in 1749 and to whom he sends his music?

* Family Gomes Costa (Pacheco) fully identified
* Violinists João Peixoto, António Vieira, António Nunes, José Lopes ...?
* His portrait sent from Vienna in 1780...?

# Style

Ciacchi & Dellaborra [2020](https://sidm.it/ojs/index.php/fmi/article/view/1044):

> "*To the ear, the effect is in some points astounding, so much as it is unpredictable, but convincing; in others, vice versa, it is incomprehensible and it seems that the succession of sounds is not determined by logic, but by the pure desire to amaze*".

> "*It is certain that Costa's catalog is not complete. (...) Curious character and musician outside the box of the time, Antonio da Costa is still waiting for an overall and documented judgment on his work.*"

Possible birth record:

> Porto, [parish of Sé](https://pesquisa.adporto.arquivos.pt/ViewerForm.aspx?id=490863)
Born: 1713-12-27
Baptized: 1714-01-01

Other alternatives exist but less likely.

Death possibly mentioned in the letters of Leonor de Almeida?

> She met him and was surely in Vienna when he died.

Possibly caricatured by Ghezzi in Rome?

> Pier Ghezzi (1674-1755) was a very prolific artist.

(Aside: Ghezzi's caricature of Francisco A. Almeida)
