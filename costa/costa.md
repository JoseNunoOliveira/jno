# *L'Abate Portoghese*

* Abott **António da Costa** (1714-1780?) was a Portuguese musician who, born in the Porto region, left the country in 1749 for Rome.

* Travelling to Venice and Paris, he eventually settled in Vienna, where he is thought to have died around 1780.

* Misantrope, he despised the positions offered to him, living most of his life in poverty.

* His intelligence and idiosincratic behaviour attracted the attention of the high nobility, in whose salons he sometimes played his compositions for violin or guitar.
