1. Best wishes and general appreciation - Generic, aim at polytypic diff‚Äôing lead to improving generic programming libraries: which contribution stronger?
2. Technical questions
3. Typos

page 4/13 - ‚Äúenumerate all combinations of insertions, deletions and copies that transform the source into the destination and choose the ‚Äòbest‚Äô one.‚Äù

page 74/83 - ‚ÄúThe only condition we impose is (semi)injectivity of wcs‚Äù. Then on page 77/86 there is a ‚Äúfunctional specification‚Äù which is not proved injective. Have you ensured this on the final implementation?

P58/67 ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the generics-mrsop heavy usage of type families triggers a memory leak in the compiler. This renders the library unusable for large families of mutu- ally recursive datatypes at the time of writing this thesis. Luckily, however, we were able to work around that by dropping the sums of products structure but maintaining a combinator-based approach in generics-simplistic, which enabled us to run our experiments with real-world data, as discussed in Chapter 6.‚Äù

P81/90 isn‚Äôt ùúë missing from the BinC and TriC clauses?
data TreeC ùúë = Hole ùúë
‚à£ LeafC Int
‚à£ BinC TreeC TreeC
‚à£ TriC TreeC TreeC TreeC

P81/90 jno, |diff x y| as a kind of residual, thus a GC between patches and trees? Need to preorder both.

P82/91 partiality, a kind of |i . (conv d)|

Jno notes
P13/22 Definition2.1.1(TreeMapping).
P27/36 rose trees etc

Typos: 

P5/P14 published with with Pierre-√âvaristeDagand.

CSI teste: FT de |‚Ä™maybe :: b->(a->b) -> Maybe a -> b| ‚Ä¨que aplica o segundo argumento ao terceiro quando este for |Just x|, retornando o primeiro argumento caso contr√°rio.
|maybe b f = either (const b) f|
